School Project I made called Super Hero Villain Registration and Battle Analysis.
The purpose is to let someone once logged in, create a character. You can create a team and team base for the character also user can make reports for the character and/or teams. 
Use the Battle Analyzer to choose two characters you have created and put them through a series of battles to see their chances of winning.

Issues  
Log in system is not authenticated.  
Issue with the text box on Battle Analysis when using backspace to empty text box.
