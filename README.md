School Project I made called Super Hero Villain Registration and Battle Analysis.
The purpose is to let someone once logged in, create a character. You can create a team and team base for the character also user can make reports for the character and/or teams. 
Use the Battle Analyzer to choose two characters you have created and put them through a series of battles to see their chances of winning.
